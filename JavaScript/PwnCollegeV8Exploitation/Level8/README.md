## Problem

The elimination of `CheckBounds` node had been changed to:
- Assume `CheckBounds` node has two input operand node `index` and `length`.
    - Each of them have a type labeled with their range `[min, max]`. 
- When `index.min >= 0.0 && index.min < length.min`, the `CheckBounds` will be eliminated.
